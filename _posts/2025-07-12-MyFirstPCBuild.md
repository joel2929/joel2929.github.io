## Objective

In March of 2023 I decided to build a PC because my laptop was showing its age and I was getting into PC gaming. I wanted a build with a small form factor, sleek/minimalist, AMD CPU, iGPU (initally at least), good enough to do some gaming, be reasonably quiet and cost no more than $1000. These are vauge criterias but that was my starting point with what I wanted and knowledge at the time. I did not know where to start so I did some research and found some great resources and tips.

## Different Fan configuration

Ultimately, this configuration gave me the best results. I was concerned the exhausted heat from the GPU would be a problem but it did not affect it as much as the oher configurations. May look into water cooling when upgrading CPU in the future.
